-    🤌 Tech stack: MERN + Socket.io + TailwindCSS + Daisy UI
-    ✌ Authentication && Authorization with JWT
-    🤘 Real-time messaging with Socket.io
-    👏 Online user status (Socket.io and React Context)
-    🖖 Global state management with Zustand
-    🦾 Error handling both on the server and on the client

## Motivation
    I wanted to learn to create an application that will stand
    out but also teach myself core fundamentals of Software Engineering.
    So I thought what better way than to learn Fullstack with the challenge
    of making an application update in real time with advanced error handling,
    a sleek UI, and data fetching. While also making it somethinbg I could get my
    family and friends to sign up for!
